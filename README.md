# LLMGraphPopulator
LLMGraphPopulator is a Python-based script designed to extract and populate graph databases using insights generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). This repository leverages several powerful technologies including LangChain Community Edition, Neo4j, and Python to automate the process of converting unstructured text into structured graph data.

# Introduction

This project is aimed at developers and data scientists who need to enrich and populate graph databases with structured information derived from natural language text. By using a Large Language Model (LLM) through LangChain, the script converts textual data into graph structures, which are then stored in a Neo4j database for further analysis and visualization.
# Features

    Data Ingestion: Seamlessly integrate and preprocess various text sources.
    LLM Integration: Use LangChain's LLM (Llama3) to extract and transform text into structured graph data.
    Graph Population: Automatically store the generated graph data into a Neo4j database.
    Error Handling: Includes detailed logging and error handling for robust performance.

# Technologies Used

    Python 3: The main programming language used for scripting and automation.
    LangChain Community Edition: Utilized for natural language processing and LLM integration.
    Neo4j: A graph database management system used to store and manage the extracted graph data.
    ChatOllama: An LLM used via LangChain for text processing and extraction.

# Configuration

The script uses environment variables for configuring the Neo4j connection:

    NEO4J_URI: The URI for the Neo4j instance (e.g., neo4j://localhost:7687).
    NEO4J_USERNAME: The username for Neo4j authentication.
    NEO4J_PASSWORD: The password for Neo4j authentication.

You can configure these in your environment or directly within the script for simplicity.
